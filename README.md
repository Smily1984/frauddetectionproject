A Consideration Point of  Fraud Detection in Bank Loans

This project used the famous "german_credit.csv" dataset and then applied on it various current classification machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, k Nearest Neighbor,  Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Xgboost Tree in order to detect the fraud cases. 

The primary idea of the project is about a consideration point of Financial Institute as they will concentrate on profit rather than only the accuracy of the models. 

This project is an early investigation on the Fraud Detection Models vs. Profit Model of Banks. To go further, we need to dig deeper into the Accuracy Improvement of the Models and the precisely of Bank Profit Calculation
